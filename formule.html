                    in sustainable cocoa farming through the Cocoa Horizons Foundation. This non-profit organisation monitors
                    the most urgent needs in West-Africa and coordinates the sustainable projects we all together contribute

                <p>If you’re like us, there’s nothing better than sour candy. For some reason, the combination of sweet and
                    tart just makes our mouth water and makes us want to keep chasing that flavor. Well,

                    candy you’ll see below is so sour that you won't be able to talk with it in your mouth. Some are so sour
                    that you'll want to spit it out as soon as you can.

                <p>Whether you call them
                    <b class="highlight">"gummy" or "gummi,"</b> whether you prefer bears or worms, whether your loyalty lies with Haribo or Black
                    Forest, there’s no denying that the gelatinous, rainbow-colored candies most of us first came to know
                    and love simply as
                    <b class="highlight">“gummy bears”</b> are one of the world’s most popular confections. Sure, chocolate bars (and the many
                    variations thereof) remain the top-selling treats across the globe, but how many cocoa-based snacks inspired
                    a hit animated TV series in the 1980s (Disney’s The Adventures of the Gummi Bears), a song with over
                    45 million hits on YouTube (The Gummy Bear Song), and played a pivotal role in the plot of an award-winning
                    Broadway musical about a transgender East German rock singer (Hedwig and the Angry Inch)?
                    <br>
                    <br> Indeed, “gummies” (for lack of a better all-encompassing term defining the vast array of available adaptations
                    on the original bear) surely have one of the most devoted followings of any candy in history; to know
                    a gummy lover is to recognize both the gleam of greedy, fiendish glee that will appear in his or her
                    eyes whenever some new form of gummy is discovered ("Oh my god, this store has gummy Smurfs!") and the
                    inner peace that can only be gained from a generous portion of an old favorite. ("There, there–eat your
                    bag of Gold-Bears and you’ll feel much better.") Yes, it’s a rabid and ever-expanding fan base; in fact,
                    according to Haribo,
                    <b class="highlight">if you laid all the Gold-Bears produced in a year head to toe, they would form a jiggly, tooth-decaying
                        ring around the earth four times. </b>
                    <br>
                    <br> And to think it all started with a poor German factory worker, a bag of sugar, and a dream.

                <br>
                <p>The Christmas Candy Cane originated in Germany about
                    <b class="highlight">250 years</b> ago. They started as straight white sugar sticks.
                    <br>
                    <br> A story says that a choirmaster, in 1670, was worried about the children sitting quietly all through
                    the long Christmas nativity service. So he gave them something to eat to keep them quiet! As he wanted
                    to remind them of Christmas, he made them into
                    <b class="highlight">a 'J' shape</b> like a shepherds crook, to remind them of the shepherds that visited the baby Jesus at
                    the first christmas. However, the earliest records of 'candy canes' comes from over 200 years later,
                    so the story, although rather nice, probably isn't true!
                    <br>
                    <br>Sometime around 1900 the
                    <b class="highlight">red stripes</b> were added and they were flavored with peppermint or wintergreen.
                    <br>
                    <br> Sometimes other Christian meanings are giving to the parts of the canes. The 'J' can also mean Jesus.
                    The white of the cane can represent the purity of Jesus Christ and the red stripes are for the blood
                    he shed when he died on the cross. The peppermint flavor can represent the hyssop plant that was used
                    for purifying in the Bible.
                    <br>
                    <br>Around 1920, Bob McCormack, from Georgia, USA, started making canes for his friends and family. They
                    became more and more popular and he started his own business called Bob's Candies. Bob McCormack's brother-in-law,
                    Gregory Harding Keller, who was a Catholic priest, invented the
                    <b class="highlight">'Keller Machine'</b> that made turning straight candy sticks into curved candy canes automatically! In
                    2005, Bob's Candies was bought by Farley and Sathers but they still make candy canes!
